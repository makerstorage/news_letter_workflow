## 1. Jeff Bezos Returns as Co-CEO of AI Startup Project Prometheus

Jeff Bezos is stepping back into a CEO role for the first time since leaving Amazon in 2021. The billionaire will co-lead Project Prometheus, a new AI company focused on applying artificial intelligence to "the physical economy" — research, engineering, and manufacturing. His co-CEO will be Dr. Vik Bajaj, a physicist who previously led life sciences work at Google X and Verily. The company is reportedly pursuing major funding and represents Bezos' most hands-on venture since Amazon.

This is significant because it signals a major shift from software-focused AI applications to physical world problems, and brings one of tech's most successful executives back into an operational leadership role.

## 2. Anthropic Uncovers First AI-Orchestrated Cyber Espionage Campaign

The campaign was allegedly 90% autonomous, though researchers have questioned this claim. The incident raises serious concerns about AI tools being weaponized for sophisticated, scaled cyber operations. Multiple sources covered this as a landmark security development, marking a potential turning point in how AI systems can be exploited for malicious purposes.

## 3. Meta's Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun Plans to Leave for Own Startup

Yann LeCun, one of the "godfathers of AI" and Meta's chief AI scientist, is reportedly planning to leave the company to launch his own startup. According to the Financial Times, LeCun is in early talks to raise funding and expects to depart in the coming months. This follows Meta's recent restructuring that cut approximately 600 jobs from LeCun's Fundamental AI Research unit, as the company shifts focus to its Superintelligence Labs group led by new chief AI officer Alexandr Wang (formerly CEO of Scale AI, which Meta acquired for $14.3 billion).

The departure of such a foundational figure in AI research signals major shifts in both Meta's AI strategy and the broader competitive landscape.

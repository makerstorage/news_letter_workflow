## 2. Google DeepMind Advances AI Agents with SIMA 2 Training in Virtual Worlds

Google DeepMind is using its Gemini model to train next-generation AI agents inside virtual worlds like Goat Simulator 3, marking a significant step toward more general-purpose AI. The SIMA 2 agents can figure out how to solve problems independently within virtual environments, potentially leading to better robots and more capable autonomous systems. This approach could bridge the gap between AI that works in controlled settings and AI that can handle real-world complexity.

## 3. Google Introduces New AI Training Method for Complex Reasoning

Researchers at Google Cloud and UCLA have developed Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a novel framework that significantly improves how language models learn challenging multi-step reasoning tasks. The method reformulates problem-solving as a sequence of logical actions, providing richer learning signals during training and enabling smaller models to tackle complex reasoning previously reserved for larger systems.

## 4. ChatGPT Launches Group Chats Feature

OpenAI has officially launched Group Chats for ChatGPT, allowing multiple users to join the same conversation and interact both with each other and with the underlying LLM. The feature, which was first discovered in leaked code before being officially announced, is now available online and via mobile apps, though not yet rolled out to all users. This represents a significant evolution in how people can collaborate using AI assistants.

## 5. Research Shows AI Agents Fail Without Human Partnership

Groundbreaking research from Upwork reveals that AI agents powered by the world's most advanced language models routinely fail to complete even straightforward professional tasks when working independently. The study demonstrates that AI agents excel when paired with human partners but struggle with autonomous operation, challenging assumptions about near-term AI capabilities and highlighting the continued importance of human-AI collaboration rather than full automation.
